# A port of the _RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial_ edition 2022, with Rust and macroquad

This is my repository for the 2022 edition of the [RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](https://old.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/vhfsda/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/).

The tutorial itself can be found [here](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/).

While the tutorial uses Python with the `tcod` library, I'll instead be writing Rust and trying out the
[macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad) library.

## Logbook

I aim to document my journey. My logbooks can be found [here](logbook).
