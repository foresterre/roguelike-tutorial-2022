## Introduction

Welcome to the first logbook of my Roguelike Tutorial 2022 implementation.

In this logbook, I aim to document my experience in participating in the 2022
edition of the [RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](https://old.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/vhfsda/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/).

While the official source will use Python with libctod, I'll be using [macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad) instead.

To start, I'll be first following the macroquad getting-started guide from its readme.
From here, I'll continue with the official week RonguelikeDev week 01 tutorial.

Let's get started!

### Setting-up macroquad

I'll assume [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) itself is present on the system, and we'll also use Cargo, which should be included as a default component
of your Rust toolchain.

```bash
$ rustc --version
rustc 1.61.0 (fe5b13d68 2022-05-18)
$ cargo --version
cargo 1.61.0 (a028ae42f 2022-04-29)
```

First, create a new rust project with Cargo:

```bash
$ cargo new --bin roguelike-tutorial-2022
```

Then, to add `macroquad` as a dependency:

```bash
$ cd roguelike-tutorial-2022
$ cargo add macroquad
   Updating 'https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index' index
      Adding macroquad v0.3.20 to dependencies.
             Features:
             + audio
             + quad-snd
             - backtrace
             - log
             - log-rs
```

As suggested by [macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad#setting-up-a-macroquad-project)'s getting-started guide, let's add some code in `src/main.rs` to determine whether
our setup works:

```rust
use macroquad::prelude::*;

#[macroquad::main("Crabby Cave")]
async fn main() {
    loop {
        clear_background(RED);

        draw_line(40.0, 40.0, 100.0, 200.0, 15.0, BLUE);
        draw_rectangle(screen_width() / 2.0 - 60.0, 100.0, 120.0, 60.0, GREEN);
        draw_circle(screen_width() - 30.0, screen_height() - 30.0, 15.0, YELLOW);

        draw_text("CRABBY CAVE WHOOP WHOOP!", 20.0, 20.0, 30.0, DARKGRAY);

        next_frame().await
    }
}
```

If you compile and run the program, a window should appear containing a line, a rectangle, a circle and the text "CRABBY CAVE WHOOP WHOOP!",
all rendered on top of a red background. Each of the respective render functions are defined by `macroquad` in the `prelude` module which
is imported at the top of our file. We also already have a main render loop `loop { ... }`, in which we draw a series of
graphical elements. At the end of the loop scope, we wait for the rendering to finish drawing the frame with the `next_frame`
function. Since we're using `async` rust for just the main loop, we have to await this rendering function.

The `macroquad` author explains in more detail why we're using `async` for the main loop [here](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad/tree/04a53d07976337c212656a897ec93cee75d006d2#asyncawait).
